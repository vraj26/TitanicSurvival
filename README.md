# TitanicSurvival

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

The Titanic dataset provides information on the fate of the passengers on the Titanic, summarizes according to economic status, sex, age and survival.
My task is to predict the survival of the Titanic passengers using a Machine Learning model.


STEPS THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM:

1. I started with data exploration, performed missing data checks in the dataset as well as learned which features would be important to predict survivability
2. I converted all categorical features into numerical ones
3. I built a classifier which would be able to predict survival
4. I also evaluasted the model performance using the classification report
